Testing Python GUI for CS205

Trying to see how I can do something with a GUI in Python.

- wxPython seems like the easiest path.
- wxHello.py is a simple example for a Mac - it brings up a small window with a message inside it.
- You have to start it with pythonw wxHello.py (I think pythonw avoids the command line/terminal - see <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9705982/pythonw-exe-or-python-exe>).
- Thinking re: something in a web browser, too, if that doesn't work out. Maybe I can connect to Javascript.
